Hello!
This is an application I am in progress writing, its mostly GUI layout work at the moment.
I am way over the 50 line limit and it does demostrate my understanding of python so far.
to run first do "pip install customtkinter" and then python app.py. It should launch the landing page for my
application which is currently just a couple text boxes and some buttons to interact with.
